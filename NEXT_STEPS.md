# NEXT STEPS - SIMPLE!

## What Needs to Be Done:

### 1. Download Open WebUI
```bash
chmod +x download_openwebui.sh
./download_openwebui.sh
```

This will:
- Clone Open WebUI from GitHub
- Put it in the `/openwebui/` directory
- Keep the existing `agent_connector.py` file

### 2. Run Migration Script
```bash
chmod +x migrate_repository.sh
./migrate_repository.sh
```

This will:
- Move `/discovery-docs/` → `/fort-knox-apis/`
- Move `/extracted-data/` → `/fort-knox-apis/`
- Move `/mcp-server/` → `/mcp-tools/`
- Clean up old directories

## That's It!

After these two commands, the repository will have the structure we want:

```
google-mcp-fortknox/
├── /openwebui (with full Open WebUI source)
├── /agents (already has 5 agents)
├── /fort-knox-apis (Google API docs)
├── /mcp-tools (organized MCP tools)
└── /shared-memory (agent communication)
```

Then another AI can analyze the Open WebUI source code and figure out how to integrate it with the agents that are already built.

## Current Status:
- ✅ All scripts are created and ready
- ✅ All 5 agents are built
- ✅ Agent connector is ready
- ⏳ Just need to run the two scripts above
