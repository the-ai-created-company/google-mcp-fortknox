# Google MCP Fort Knox - Architecture Vision

## 🎯 Vision: Self-Contained AI Agent Ecosystem

This repository is being transformed into a self-contained ecosystem where AI agents live alongside their documentation and tools, with Open WebUI as their chat interface.

## 📁 Target Architecture

## 🔄 Migration Status

### Phase 1: Repository Restructuring ✅
- [x] Architecture vision documented
- [x] Agent framework created
- [x] Directory structure established
- [ ] Open WebUI integration pending

### Phase 2: Open WebUI Integration
- [ ] Download Open WebUI source
- [ ] Refactor for local agent communication
- [ ] Remove external dependencies
- [ ] Add agent discovery mechanism

### Phase 3: Agent Implementation
- [x] Base agent framework created
- [x] Agent templates established
- [ ] Inter-agent communication system
- [ ] Shared memory implementation

## 🚀 Key Innovations

1. **Agents Live With Data**: No API calls needed to access documentation
2. **Self-Modification**: Agents can modify their own environment
3. **Tool Generation**: Agents create tools as needed
4. **Direct Access**: No bridges or APIs between components
5. **Autonomous Growth**: System expands itself

## 🎉 End Goal

A completely autonomous system where:
- Users chat with agents through Open WebUI
- Agents have direct access to all Google API documentation
- Agents create new tools and capabilities on demand
- Agents spawn specialized sub-agents as needed
- The entire system lives and evolves within this single repository
