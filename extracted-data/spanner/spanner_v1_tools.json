The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be one of: `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `!=`, `=`, or `:`. Colon `:` is the contains operator. Filter rules are not case sensitive. The following fields in the Operation are eligible for filtering: * `name` - The name of the long-running operation * `done` - False if the operation is in progress, else true. * `metadata.@type` - the type of metadata. For example, the type string for CreateInstanceConfigMetadata is `type.googleapis.com/google.spanner.admin.instance.v1.CreateInstanceConfigMetadata`. * `metadata.` - any field in metadata.value. `metadata.@type` must be specified first, if filtering on metadata fields. * `error` - Error associated with the long-running operation. * `response.@type` - the type of response. * `response.` - any field in response.value. You can combine multiple expressions by enclosing each expression in parentheses. By default, expressions are combined with AND logic. However, you can specify AND, OR, and NOT logic explicitly. Here are a few examples: * `done:true` - The operation is complete. * `(metadata.@type=` \\ `type.googleapis.com/google.spanner.admin.instance.v1.CreateInstanceConfigMetadata) AND` \\ `(metadata.instance_config.name:custom-config) AND` \\ `(metadata.progress.start_time < \\\"2021-03-28T14:50:00Z\\\") AND` \\ `(error:*)` - Return operations where: * The operation's metadata type is CreateInstanceConfigMetadata. * The instance configuration name contains \"custom-config\". * The operation started before 2021-03-28T14:50:00Z. * The operation resulted in an error.",

For example, the type string for CreateInstancePartitionMetadata is `type.googleapis.com/google.spanner.admin.instance.v1.CreateInstancePartitionMetadata`. * `metadata.` - any field in metadata.value. `metadata.@type` must be specified first, if filtering on metadata fields. * `error` - Error associated with the long-running operation. * `response.@type` - the type of response. * `response.` - any field in response.value. You can combine multiple expressions by enclosing each expression in parentheses. By default, expressions are combined with AND logic. However, you can specify AND, OR, and NOT logic explicitly. Here are a few examples: * `done:true` - The operation is complete. * `(metadata.@type=` \\ `type.googleapis.com/google.spanner.admin.instance.v1.CreateInstancePartitionMetadata) AND` \\ `(metadata.instance_partition.name:custom-instance-partition) AND` \\ `(metadata.start_time < \\\"2021-03-28T14:50:00Z\\\") AND` \\ `(error:*)` - Return operations where: * The operation's metadata type is CreateInstancePartitionMetadata. * The instance partition name contains \"custom-instance-partition\". * The operation started before 2021-03-28T14:50:00Z. * The operation resulted in an error.",
