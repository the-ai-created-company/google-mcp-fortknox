# Execute Download Instructions

To download Open WebUI into the repository, run:

```bash
# Clone the repository locally
git clone https://github.com/the-ai-created-company/google-mcp-fortknox.git
cd google-mcp-fortknox

# Make the download script executable
chmod +x download_openwebui.sh

# Run the download script
./download_openwebui.sh
```

This will:
1. Download Open WebUI from the official repository
2. Place it in the `/openwebui` directory
3. Preserve the custom `agent_connector.py` file
4. Create a merged README with both Open WebUI and Fort Knox instructions

After running this script, the repository structure will be complete with:
- ✅ `/openwebui` - Full Open WebUI code (refactored for agents)
- ✅ `/agents` - AI agents (already exists)
- ✅ `/fort-knox-apis` - Google API docs (already exists)
- ✅ `/mcp-tools` - Generated tools (already exists)

## Note
Since I cannot execute shell scripts directly from GitHub, you'll need to run this locally and then push the changes back to the repository.
